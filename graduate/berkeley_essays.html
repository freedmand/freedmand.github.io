<h1>Statement of Purpose</h1>
<div class="prompt">Please describe your aptitude and motivation for graduate study in journalism, including your preparation for this field of study, your academic plans or research interests, and your future career goals. Please be specific about why UC Berkeley would be a good intellectual fit for you. You may also want to include the reasons you would like to attend the Graduate School of Journalism at this point in your career.</div>

<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Some people &ldquo;unfriended&rdquo; on Facebook, others crowded streets to protest &mdash; the 2016 election caused me to question the unchecked proliferation of false news, the glaring bias in established newspapers, and the siloed atmosphere of online media that sowed divisions amongst an already polarized American public. In an age when computer algorithms can search trillions of websites in milliseconds, </span><span class="c0">why have they done little to standardize the trustworthiness of online news, where anyone with Internet connectivity can become a global publisher?</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Eager to explore such themes, I am drawn to the intersection of computation and journalism.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My interdisciplinary experience at Harvard culminated with my thesis: &ldquo;Correlational Harmonic Metrics: Bridging Computational and Human Notions of Musical Harmony.&rdquo; The project aimed to unify the way humans and computer algorithms label chord progressions in songs. By adapting genomic methods to the language of chords, I derived a system to measure harmonic similarity between songs. I then optimized the system&#39;s parameters to strongly correlate the performance of human-labeled and algorithmically-labeled chords. The results suggest that a chord progression search engine or other information retrieval system can perform well without human ground-truth data.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This research, which I presented at an international music informatics conference</span><span class="c0">, demonstrates the application of computation to deeply human domains. Though I majored in computer science and music, I am fervent about bringing computation to writing and journalism. Words, the most direct distillation of thought, inform, evoke, and persuade &mdash; </span><span class="c0">they carry the weight of our cultural ethos with effortless fluidity. Journalism quests for broad societal truth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After graduating in 2015, I worked on my own ideas for 3 months before joining Google full-time. NewsMap, an interactive map of international news, provides an interface to show where stories unfold and how their coverage differs geographically, which I hope to evolve into a medium for live citizen reporting. Collabowrite, a collaborative writing website, brings people together to write a fiction story page by page, publishing the most liked user submission each day. I plan to revisit open, crowdsourced journalism platforms in graduate school, focusing on credibility and neutrality.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As a software engineer in Google&#39;s Sound Understanding group, which aims to bestow machines with superhuman hearing, I coordinate ground-truth data collection through human rating tasks. This work, which has led to the largest published audio event dataset, has equipped me valuably with skills in machine learning, website creation, and research writing. Though my experience at Google is fulfilling, grouping me with PhDs and professors, I aim to return to school to pursue the untapped civic bug that stirs within me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At Berkeley, I hope to study with David Cohn, whose work in citizen reporting is seminal, and Richard Hernandez, a pioneer for interactive storytelling on the modern web. Post graduation, I would like to write for a newspaper, mine and visualize data, or reinvent a more credible web ecosystem. Ideally, I want to immerse myself in the full production: building infrastructure for integrity, writing stories with interactive data, and sharing truth globally.</span></p>

<h1>Personal essay</h1>
<div class="prompt">Please describe how your personal background and experiences shaped your decision to pursue a journalism graduate degree. In this section, you may also include any relevant information on how you overcame barriers to access higher education, evidence of how you have come to understand the barriers faced by others, evidence of your academic service to advance equitable access to higher education for women, racial minorities, and individuals from other groups that have been historically underrepresented in higher education, evidence of your research focusing on underserved populations or related issues of inequality, or evidence of your leadership among such groups. The Personal History Statement is required for all applicants. Please note that the Personal History Statement should not duplicate the Statement of Purpose. You may want to include the reasons that you have decided to become a reporter.

<p class="c3"><span class="c1">It started as a fanciful party conversation &mdash; &quot;Hey, we should go on a road trip&quot; &mdash; and ended in an 11,000 mile journey through the patchwork of America. Without staying in a single hotel, two college friends and I connected the dots of every friend and family member we knew and set off in a black Jetta for five weeks in the summer after freshman year.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">The circuitous route through 35 states afforded me ample time for reflection. As an introverted extrovert, I am in constant battle between being shy and wanting to push boundaries. Growing up, the glow of computer monitors shielded me from &ldquo;hanging out&rdquo; but led me to produce projects on random number generation and text compression that I presented at international science fairs. The black and white keys of my family&#39;s Baldwin piano were a private emotional forum that I went on to share with hundreds at talent shows. And the notepads my parents gifted me every birthday, flycatchers for my errant thoughts, kindled a self-actualizing valedictory speech I delivered on doing &ldquo;things in life that scare the hell out of you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">We arrive to torrential downpour in Michigan in the safety of our car. Back in Cambridge, Alister sat on the sidewalk every day against the Harvard Bookstore, even in blizzards, but would always strike a conversation; he never asked for money but was grateful to receive meals from generous passerbys. Though empathy can be short-lived, stories carry on. One winter day he lamented his friend, who had slept outside in near zero degree weather and never saw the sun rise. He was wearing three coats.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">As I drive the red roads of Wyoming, my passengers are fast asleep from the humdrum of driving. The tech life I am creeping into steers me through internships that reveal complacent day-to-day office spaces. I love computer science, but what appeals to me is primarily its applications. From scraping a national database of imports and exports and designing webpages for a German bus line, to generating music using a physical dissonance model and drafting my own minimalist text editor for writing, my side projects connect me to my data, which in turn connects me to the world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">We pass a mountain peak near Seattle and catch our first glimpse of the Pacific ocean, the jagged edge of a frontier land. Pursuing journalism was never an obvious answer for me, but always inevitable because of my strong desire to make a difference by seeking out and intertwining stories. As a field that demands introspective thinking but requires interviewing strangers and publishing globally, journalism demands introverted extroverted professionals. As a field that is evolving as fluidly as that of computation, journalism necessitates presenting information in new media through design and visualization as a complement to prose. As the blackbox of America came together for me through my adventure, so too does journalism through the shared experiences of a collective society. I want to be part of that conversation.</span></p>
