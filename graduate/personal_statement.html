<h1>Personal statement</h1>
<div class="prompt">The personal statement, limited to two pages, should provide a brief description of your academic and professional activities and accomplishments, as well as any other information that you feel can help us evaluate your potential to succeed in the program.</div>

<p>In the age of transition, old and new &mdash; analog and digital, print and pixel &mdash; coexist, as expressive mediums evolve and an automating society innovates. In the crevice between the book-bound past and technological future, journalism is the grass that sprouts up: the resilient base of a world of information.</p>
<p>As an undergraduate, I was torn between three potential paths: music, computer science, and journalism. As an informally trained pianist, I improvised spontaneous soliloquies that tempted me into the richly theoretical world of music. Programming, which started as a hobby in elementary school, gave me the mechanical advantage to leverage huge amounts of data and present web interfaces globally. And journalism, a dialogue with society &mdash; a tantalizing slice of law, ethics, culture, accountability, politics, and history &mdash; grounded me as the means to truly enmesh into the communal story.</p>
<p>I majored in computer science and music. It is hard for me to pin down where exactly writing eluded me. As a freshman I went from a course on literature and sexuality to an expository writing seminar on lovesickness. I failed twice to get into the <i>Harvard Lampoon</i>, a satirical humor publication, and my motivations never aligned with <i>The Harvard Crimson</i>, the campus newspaper. My junior year, a <a href="https://www.iesabroad.org/study-abroad/programs/vienna-music" target="blank_">semester abroad</a> in Vienna renewed my wonder in music, in the emotional and evocative treasures buried in the archaic songs of baroque masterminds. For two summers, I interned as a software engineer in advertising at Google, the company with perhaps the largest worldwide stake in digital information. But it felt like something essential was missing.</p>
<p>My undergraduate career culminated in a <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/14398545" target="blank_">thesis project</a> that mixed computational analysis with <i>The Beatles</i>. My specific research question asked whether there was a way to measure the similarity of songs based on their computed harmonic content. Rather than rely on human transcriptions of chord progressions, could computational algorithms which estimate the chords in an audio file still preserve a similar notion of harmonic similarity? I constructed a system to measure harmonic similarity &mdash; by adapting algorithms renowned in computational genomics to the music domain &mdash; and applied it to the discography of <i>The Beatles</i>.</p>
<p>In the months following my 2015 graduation and before starting full-time at Google, I tried to capture the missing parts of my college experience in a startup. My idea, <i>NewsMap</i>, was a website that could geolocate the current news on a world map. The interface would show where news events were taking place, as well as how a story&rsquo;s coverage differed worldwide. My nascent journalistic vision was that aggregating the locality of news could provide new insights and highlight varied viewpoints. My stretch goal &mdash; providing a crowdsourced platform for citizen reporting in real-time &mdash; unfortunately did not come to fruition in time.</p>
<p>In late October, right before starting Google, I flew to the Spanish coastal city of M&aacute;laga to present a <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b7c9/96366263ebeeb67bfe96edb45a0ad618cb44.pdf" target="blank_">paper</a> of my thesis project at the <a href="http://www.ismir.net/" target="blank_"><i>International Society for Music Information Retrieval</i></a> conference. Days later, I began work in Mountain View, California, building internal tools to debug the company&rsquo;s ad targeting models. Fresh from a summer of exploration in news, geography, music informatics, and open source, I found my role restrictive and divergent from my values. Fortunately, there was a brighter side of Google for me &mdash; the Sound Understanding team &mdash; which I transitioned into after six months of bureaucratic due diligence.</p>
<p>Nestled in <a href="http://research.google.com/pubs/MachinePerception.html" target="blank_">Google Research and Machine Perception</a>, my new team trains machines to hear like humans. I am put in charge of building interfaces for contracted workers to annotate sounds in YouTube, to be fed into massive machine learning models. The cast of teammates is a childhood dream come true: a curious MIT grad who was sued in college by the Boston Transportation Authority for hacking the subway system; a fast-witted manager whose academic name is &ldquo;Rif A. Saurous&rdquo;; and the humble team lead who takes pictures of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_wasp#/media/File:Polistes_dominula_nest_-_paper_wasps.jpg" target="blank_">wasp nests</a> for Wikipedia, collects slide rules, and invented the optical mouse at Xerox. While I am manning millions of data points, thriving with PhDs, professors, and visionaries in an oxymoronic job &mdash; profitable researcher &mdash; in the heart of Silicon Valley, something is still missing.</p>
<p>As I watch election coverage from <i>CNN</i> to <i>Fox News</i>; immerse myself senselessly in accounts, diatribes, and debates on <i>Facebook</i> and <i>Reddit</i>; watch shows like Aaron Sorkin&rsquo;s <i>The Newsroom</i> or the Nora Ephron dramatization <i>Good Girls Revolt</i>; engage with foreign policy from <i>The Economist</i> or food reviews from <i>The New Yorker</i>; and listen to the news during my morning commute on <i>National Public Radio</i> &mdash; I know that I want to be a part of the conversation.</p>
